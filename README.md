# JavaScript30-Drum-Kit
JavaScript drum kit based on user keyboard events. This code I created when learnng JavaScript30 course.

Just clone the repo, run index.html on your favorite browser and on your keyboard press keys A,S, D, F, G, H, J, K, L to make different drum voice and start playing with it. 

The main Javascript code lies in index.html file. 

I created this source code by learning JavaScript30 online course from Wesbos.
